# about my name in [toki pona]{lang="tok-Latn"}

(written 2023-02-10 by [tonsi tenpi]{lang="tok-Latn"}, that's me!)

<abbr title="too long, didn't read">tl;dr</abbr> [**jan tenpi**]{lang="tok-Latn"} [jan \[tonsi en nanpa pan ijo\]]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"} (or [**tonsi tenpi**]{lang="tok-Latn"}) is fine

though, you may have questions...

## for starters: why [tenpi]{lang="tok-Latn"}?

well, i first went through the regular means of making names; _tokiponisation_:

- _"Daphne"_ becomes [Teni]{lang="tok-Latn"} (or [Tani]{lang="tok-Latn"})
  - oof, not to diss that name or say it's strictly masculine, but i just know people whose names are Tani. it also doesn't have the same _mouthfeel_ as "daph".
- _Day_ becomes [Te]{lang="tok-Latn"}
  - i also don't feel super about that name. it's short, which i like (they say that the shorter your name is, the better a gamer you are...), but it doesn't _feel like me_.

so, these options aren't viable to me. what's next? you guessed it! _it's bodging time, baby!_

what about my name, _daphne_, gives it the particular mouthfeel? it's the consonant cluster: **-phn-**! it's phonotactically impossible in toki pona (but if it were, and we would restrict it to just the toki pona alphabet, it would look like [*Tepni*]{lang="tok-Latn"})

but you can now see where we are going with this: let's swap those consonants (toki pona is <abbr title="consonant-vowel-N syllable structure">CVN</abbr> thankfully) and apply a healthy amount of _anticapitali&mdash;_ i mean make it lowercase (stylistic choice), then, _bam_, you get [tenpi]{lang="tok-Latn"}

this is the only time i'll acknowledge that my name is "daphne" and not "daph". heh.

### it's so close to [tenpo]{lang="tok-Latn"}!

*yeah, it is!* i like that! it makes for great puns! see a clock? "[ilo tenpi]{lang="tok-Latn"}"!

have you ever accidentally typed "[tenpi]{lang="tok-Latn"}" instead of "[tenpo]{lang="tok-Latn"}"? were you expecting the glyph [tenpo]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"} to appear, but instead, you got :Icon{name="IconsTenpiSquare"}? well, that's me! sorry about that! sorry if that was confusing!

## what's your headnoun?

**any!** any that reasonably applies to me, to be exact! here's some good ones:

[jan]{lang="tok-Latn"} [jan]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, [tonsi]{lang="tok-Latn"} [tonsi]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, [mani]{lang="tok-Latn"} [mani]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, [meli]{lang="tok-Latn"} [meli]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, and if you get to know me, feel free to play around with more! maybe i'll like it!

just like my pronouns, i have no particular preference between the above.

## what's up with your name in [sitelen pona]{lang="tok-Latn"}?

if you're on this website, you have seen it: :Icon{name="IconsTenpiSquare" alt="tenpi"}, it follows the [nasin sitelen kalama](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_sitelen_kalama){lang="tok-Latn"} which is widely understood in the community (but not explained in the official sourcebook, *Toki Pona: The Language of Good* (2014) by [jan Sonja]{lang="tok-Latn"}).

it just is formatted in halfwidth (maybe even quarterwidth) characters and has a funny glyph. and... to explain the hourglass glyph, i need you to follow me into this rabbit hole real quick:

### [ten(po)]{lang="tok-Latn"}

before i begin, let me say i don't necessarily see this as a negative. i'm not blaming anyone for this very mild confusion.

1. first, i don't remember what came first:
   - [lipu Linku](https://linku.la) lists [**ten**]{lang="tok-Latn"} with the definition: "(shortened variant of [tenpo]{lang="tok-Latn"})"
   - [Fairfax Pona HD](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfaxponahd/) has the hourglass gliph listed as `ten2`
2. then, through one of [jan Kekan San]{lang="tok-Latn"}'s VR lessons, i learned that some speakers use the hourglass as alternate glyph for [**tenpo**]{lang="tok-Latn"}
3. and then, i learned that [**ten**]{lang="tok-Latn"} with the hourglass glyph is a [nimi sin]{lang="tok-Latn"} (community-made new word) for **the number 10** (the glyph should then be interpreted as a latin numeral 10: â…©, but with an line under and over)

any or all of these could be true, and i don't have a problem with that. in the end, it works in my benefit: whether it means [ten]{lang="tok-Latn"} or [tenpo]{lang="tok-Latn"}, it still starts with "ten"!

### what about [jan \[tonsi en nanpa pan ijo\]]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"} ?

oh, in short, i just like food (hence [pan]{lang="tok-Latn"} [pan]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, meaning bread and rice and corn and so on), and i like being a nerd ([nanpa]{lang="tok-Latn"} [nanpa]{lang="tok-x-stlnpona"}, meaning data in this interpretation).

i feel like the square name glyph looks good as a logo, and the long cartouche looks good as a banner or shirt design (i actually put it on my VRChat avatar!) and it also works if the hourglass glyph is not available on a certain typeface.
