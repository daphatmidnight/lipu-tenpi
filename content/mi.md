  ::Details
  #summary
  here's some places where i refuse to go

  #default
  - **twitter** (because it stinks and the owner stinks) <small>(bad stink)</small> (they platform fascists)
  - **facebook** <small>(and any other facebook product i.e. threads, instagram, whatsapp)</small> (because they are [war criminals](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/)) (also they banned me for [changing my name](https://gizmodo.com/facebook-apologizes-over-real-name-policy-offensive-to-1641335002)) (they too platform fascists)
  - **bluesky** (because it's twitter 2.0 and funded by cryptobros pushing bad ideas and following the [same doomed path as twitter](https://social.nano.lgbt/notes/9xrcgxcckqwmxwev))
  - **telegram** (because they're [actual nazis](https://plush.city/@PsyChuan/112336464469767051) and like to [ban queer ppl](https://social.treehouse.systems/@dee/112002194608284452))
