  <details>
  <summary>here's some places where i am not, and will likely never be:</summary>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>twitter</strong> (because it stinks and the owner stinks) <small>(bad stink)</small></li>
  <li><strong>facebook</strong> <small>(and any other facebook product)</small> (because they are war criminals) (also they banned me for changing my name)</li>
  <li><strong>bluesky</strong> (because it's twitter 2.0 and funded by cryptobros pushing bad ideas and following the same doomed path as twitter)</li>
  </ul>
